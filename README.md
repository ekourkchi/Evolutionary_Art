# Evolutionary Art

This package is written as a demonstration for a user directed evolutionary art. The idea is to evolve an existing Video or Image where the user plays the selection role using a GUI. In the current version, the user can only choose one image/video which would be then mutated to produce more options. As the user plays along, (s)he can guide the evolution in order to magnify the desired features, (s)he is looking for.

In this example, the original image is always displayed on bottom-left panel. The chosen images is displayed to the right of the original image and all other panels are generated by mutating the selected image.

# How to Install

Since the extension part of this package is written in C, you need to first compile and install this part.

           python setup.py install

This would compile the C library and make the library available for your Python compiler. You can also separately install the C extension using the *Makefile*. In this case, you probably you need to add the Python and Numpy libraries to "C_INCLUDE_PATH" environmental variable

           export C_INCLUDE_PATH='<Python_Directory>/python/include/python2.7/'
           export C_INCLUDE_PATH=$C_INCLUDE_PATH':<Python_Directory>/variants/common/lib/python2.7/site-packages/numpy/core/include/'

You can test if you have successfully installed the required python package by
           import imfilters as imf
