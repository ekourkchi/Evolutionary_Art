# Evolutionary Art

This package is written as a demonstration for a user directed evolutionary art. The idea is to evolve an existing Video or Image where the user plays the selection role using a GUI. In the current version, the user can only choose one image/video which would be then mutated to produce more options. As the user plays along, (s)he can guide the evolution in order to magnify the desired features, (s)he is looking for.

In this example, the original image is always displayed on bottom-left panel. The chosen images is displayed to the right of the original image and all other panels are generated by mutating the selected image.
