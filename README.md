# Evolutionary Art

This package is written as a demonstration for a user directed evolutionary art. The idea is to evolve an existing Video or Image where the user plays the selection role using a GUI. In the current version, the user can only choose one image/video which would be then mutated to produce more options. As the user plays along, (s)he can guide the evolution in order to magnify the desired features, (s)he is looking for.
